# To-Do-List
# Simple To-Do List 📝

A simple, lightweight To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is my first project to practice DOM manipulation and frontend basics.

## 🚀 Features
* **Add Tasks:** Users can type a task and add it to the list.
* **Delete Tasks:** Each task has a delete button to remove it from the list.
* **Responsive Design:** Clean interface that works on different screen sizes.
* **Input Validation:** Prevents adding empty tasks.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5** - For structure
* **CSS3** - For styling
* **JavaScript (Vanilla)** - For functionality

## 📂 How to Run
1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/my-todo-list.git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/my-todo-list.git)
    ```
2.  Open the folder in VS Code (or any code editor).
3.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
* Add a "Mark as Complete" feature.
* Save tasks to LocalStorage so they don't disappear on refresh.
* Add Dark Mode.
